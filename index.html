                    that challenges me is myself. As a fighter, friend and an employee
                    I am known as contemplative, tortured and driven.

                    Amongst many fighters of the past was featured in the
                    movie "Ready Player One". Ryu ready always!

                  <p>
                    United with unknown until then to me Power Rangers to
                    defeat resurrected M.Bison. Damn good fighters they are,
                    even not knowing karate ways!

                  <p>
                    In "Street Fighter V" once and for all erased M.Bison from
                    earth and tamed my inner Evil Ryu. Also spent some time on
                    a side-project, mini-series "Street Fighter: Resurrection".

                    Filmed in a martial arts tutorial "Street Fighter:

                    The gods of intenet concluded me in the animated movie

                    My evil alter ego sneaked out of control and became a

                    Borrowed my famous ripped gi to Soki in
                    "Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams", gods informed me he needed
                    that for the battle.

                    Defeated M. Bison in "Street Fighter Alpha 2", bastard
                    wanted to use my heroic body for his evil intentions, but
                    retreated with shame. Also this year I encountered Marvel
                    universe in "Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes"

                    "Street Fighter Alpha 2". As a freelance on
                    "Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo" tried myself in a new
